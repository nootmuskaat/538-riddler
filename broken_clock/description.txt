You purchase a new clock but are dismayed to realize that both of its hands are
identical. At first, it seems it's going to be impossible to tell the time
because you don't know which hand is for the minutes and which is for the hours.

However, you realize you don't need to know which is which for every time - for
example, when it's 12:30, the minute hand will be exactly on the 6 and the hour
hand will be halfway between the 12 and the 1. It can't be the other way around
because if the hour hand were exactly on 6, the minute hand would have to
exactly on 12, which it's not. So you know what time it is.

How many times during the day will you not be able to tell the time?
