Lucky you! You've won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your
favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and
because you're not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to
pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can't
accept the card you presented to him because it doesn't have any drink credits
left on it.

What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How
many free drinks can you expect are still available?
