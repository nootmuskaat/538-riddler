You are competing in a spelling bee alongside nine other contestants. You can
each spell words perfectly from a certain portion of the dictionary but will
misspell any word not in that portion of the book. Specifically, you have 99
percent of the dictionary down cold, and your opponents have 98 percent, 97
percent, 96 percent, and so on down to 90 percent memorized. The bee's rules are
simple: The contestants take turns spelling in some fixed order, which then
restarts with the first surviving speller at the end of a round. Miss a word and
you're out, and the last speller standing wins. The bee words are chosen
randomly from the dictionary.

First, say the contestants go in decreasing order of their knowledge, so that
you go first. What are your chances of winning the spelling bee? Second, say the
contestants go in increasing order of knowledge, so that you go last. What are
your chances of winning now?
