Over the years, people have invented many games that simulate baseball using
two standard dice. In these games, each dice roll corresponds with a baseball
event. Two players take turns rolling dice and tracking what happens on the
field. Suppose you happen to be an ardent devotee of one of these simulated
games from the late 19th century, called Our National Ball Game, which assigns
rolls to baseball outcomes like so:

1, 1: double
1, 2: single
1, 3: single
1, 4: single
1, 5: base on error
1, 6: base on balls
2, 2: strike
2, 3: strike
2, 4: strike
2, 5: strike
2, 6: foul out
3, 3: out at 1st
3, 4: out at 1st
3, 5: out at 1st
3, 6: out at 1st
4, 4: fly out
4, 5: fly out
4, 6: fly out
5, 5: double play
5, 6: triple
6, 6: home run

Given those rules, what's the average number of runs that would be scored in
nine innings of this dice game? What's the distribution of the number of runs
scored? (Histograms welcome.) You can assume some standard baseball things,
like runners scoring from second on singles and runners scoring from third on
fly outs.
